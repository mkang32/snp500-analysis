    "* Limitations of AR or MA models \n",
    "\n",
    "  * Both AR and MA have residuals that is not white noise. This means neither of them is suitable for fitting price return data. \n",
    "  * AR limitation: fail to adjust quickly to unexpected shocks --> need MA aspects to smooth out prediction\n",
    "  * MA limitation:  need a baseline to perform well --> need to use previous values (AR) \n",
    "  * AR + MA: solves the issues each one has individually \n",

    "    * $\\epsilon_t$, $\\epsilon_{t-1}$ : Residuals for the current period and the 1 period ago respectively\n",
    "    * $c$: Baseline constant factor \n",
    "    * $\\varphi_1$: The part of the value last period is relevant in explaining the current one, $|\\varphi_n|<1$ to prevent compounded effects exploding in magnitude\n",
